Project Idea: TaskFlow - A Kanban Task Management System
Create a project management tool inspired by Jira, where users can create, manage, and track tasks using a Kanban board layout. This project will help you implement CRUD operations, user authentication, and real-time updates using Node.js and Express.

Key Features:
User Authentication:

Secure login and registration using JWT.
Password hashing with bcrypt.
Project and Team Management:

Create and manage multiple projects.
Assign users to specific projects.
Kanban Board:

Visualize tasks in columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
Drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns.
Task Management:

Add, edit, delete, and assign tasks to team members.
Task details like priority, deadlines, and subtasks.
Real-Time Updates:

Use WebSockets (socket.io) for real-time updates when tasks are updated or moved.
Activity Logs:

Record all changes made to tasks (e.g., status updates, assignments).
Search and Filter:

Search for tasks by title or description.
Filter tasks by status, priority, or assigned user.
Optional Features:

Notifications for task updates or deadlines.
Integration with calendar tools for deadlines.
Export project data as CSV or PDF.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
Frontend: React, Vue.js, or Angular (optional for advanced UI).
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (Relational).
Real-Time Communication: socket.io.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password security.
Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for responsive design.
Steps to Build:
Set Up the Backend:

Use Express.js to create RESTful APIs for task, project, and user management.
Implement authentication middleware with JWT.
Database Design:

User: id, name, email, password, roles.
Project: id, name, description, ownerId, teamMembers[].
Task: id, title, description, status, priority, dueDate, assignedUserId, projectId.
Real-Time Updates:

Integrate WebSockets to push updates for task changes across clients.
Frontend Integration:

Build a Kanban board interface with drag-and-drop (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd).
Connect the frontend to the backend APIs for dynamic updates.
Deploy the Application:

Host the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
Optionally, host the frontend on Vercel or Netlify
