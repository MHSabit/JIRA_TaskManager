## Steps to Build

### 1. Set Up the Backend
- Use Express.js to create RESTful APIs for task, project, and user management.
- Implement authentication middleware with JWT.

### 2. Database Design
- Define schemas for User, Project, and Task tables in MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

### 3. Real-Time Updates
- Integrate WebSockets using `socket.io` to push updates for task changes across clients.

### 4. Frontend Integration (Optional)
- Build a Kanban board interface with drag-and-drop functionality (e.g., `react-beautiful-dnd`).
- Connect the frontend to the backend APIs for dynamic updates.

### 5. Deploy the Application
- Host the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
- Optionally, host the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.
